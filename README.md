# C# Web Module

This folder contains various task solutions and projects for the **`C# Web Basics`** and **`ASP.NET Core`** Courses at **[Software University](https://softuni.bg/)**.

# C# Web Basics

**`C# Web Basics`** course lays the foundation of important principles and instruments used in web development, such as **HTTP Protocol**, **Cookies** and **Sessions** in general and especially in **`ASP.NET Core`** web-development framework.

For better understanding of these principles we'll write our own server and our own **MVC Framework** with support for all the basic functionalities required for a modern web application.

With the gathered knowledge we'll create our own web application with **`C#`** and **`MS SQL Server`** with separation of **Models**, **Views** and **Controllers** (**MVC**).

**Acquired Skills** :

- Working with the HTTP protocol
- Asynchronous programming
- Working with MVC template
- Working with cookies and sessions
- Creating a web server
- Creating an MVC framework

# ASP&#8228;NET Core

**`ASP.NET Core`** course teaches how to build modern web applications with the **Model-View-Controller** (**MVC**) architecture using **HTML5**, databases, **Entity Framework Core** and other technologies.

We'll examine the **`ASP.NET Core`** technology platform, its components and architecture, the creation of **MVC** web applications, defining **Models**, **Views** and **Partial Views** with **Razor View Engine**, defining **Controllers**, working with databases and integration with **Entity Framework Core**, **LINQ** and **SQL Server**.

The course also includes more complex topics, such as working with **Users**, **Roles** and **Sessions**, using **AJAX**, **caching**, **web application security**, **web sockets**, working with **MVC Controls** and several hands-on labs and workshops to build complete, full featured **`ASP.NET Core`** web applications.

The course ends with a project defense of a web application built with **`ASP.NET Core`** which can be found in this repository -> ...
